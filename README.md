# friendmanager
Friend Manager is a simple addon that allows you to save friend lists as profiles. It allows you migratie friend lists from one character to another seamlessly. 

Within the addon you can type /fm and see the available commands. /fm menu -- shows newly added UI. **Please note the List of profiles has the code for the close button but it's not appearing, clicking the list button again closes the frame.** 

If you merge profiles it will merge the friends from both into the first profile name. You must reload
to see the merger afterwards go into effect.

If you load a profile & your current profile does not have those friends it will add and remove ones that do not exist in the profile so make sure you know who you want to have added!
